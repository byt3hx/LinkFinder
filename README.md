# LinkFinder

Just modified version of this tool by fixing some errors https://github.com/GerbenJavado/LinkFinder

So what was fixed?

It will print url with output.

I fixed some ssl errors because it keeps annoying me when I run the script.

So I deleted the those two lines.

```
print("Usage: python %s [Options] use -h for help" % sys.argv[0])
print("Error: %s" % errmsg)
```
